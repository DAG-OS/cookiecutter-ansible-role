:toc-title:

First of all, thanks for taking the time and interest to contribute üéâüéâüéâ

Suggestions üí¨ and pull requests üîÄ are always welcome!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules.

== Dependencies

The following set of dependencies is required for successfully developing this role.
Install them via your favorite Python package manager.

* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html[Ansible]
* https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Molecule]
* https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit]

== Testing

With Molecule installed it is simple to test changes locally.
In the root of this repository run `mol test` for a full test run.

During the implementation of a feature or fix a more iterative workflow makes sense:

* Run `mol converge` to provision a container via the `molecule/default/converge.yml` playbook.
* Run `mol login` to log into the container.
* Run `mol verify` to execute the checks in `molecule/default/verify.yml`.
* Run `mol destroy` to clean up when you are done.

[NOTE]
.Most development is done under Windows with WSL2
====
Since WSL2 has no systemd capabilities there is different Molecule configuration for local development (`molecule.yml`) and the CI pipeline (`molecule-ci.yml`):

* A non-systemd container is used for local development.
* https://podman.io/[Podman] is used instead of Docker.
  Either install the Molecule driver (`molecule-podman`) or use Docker locally.

== Styleguides

=== Git commit messages

The following style guide reflects personal preferences as well as best practices as described in the https://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html[Pro Git book].

* Limit the first line to 50 characters or less.
* Start the first line with an applicable emoji from https://gitmoji.dev/.
* Use the present tense.

* Leave a blank line between title and body.
* Limit remaining lines to 72 characters or less.

----
üìù Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. The blank line separating
the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
entirely); tools like rebase will confuse you if you run the two
together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

* Bullet points are okay, too
* Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space
* Use a hanging indent

NOTE: You may reference issues and pull requests liberally in the message body.
